### Conference Papers
 - ICTAC23: [**Denotational Semantics for Symbolic Execution**](/files/2023-ICTAC-article.pdf)
   
   Co-authored with Erik Voogd. We present a simple denotational view of symbolic execution in which path conditions are partitions of the initial state space and symbolic states describe state transformers.
   
 - CONCUR23: [**Compositional Correctness and Completeness for Symbolic Partial Order Reduction**](/files/2023-CONCUR-article.pdf)
   
   In which I formalize a symbolic small step semantics in Coq and do partial order reduction to it. Also there is a neat square. [(slides)](/files/2023-CONCUR-presentation.pdf)
   

### Master Thesis
I did my master thesis with [HÃ¥kon Robbestad Gylterud](https://hakon.gylterud.net/) at [UiB](https://hdl.handle.net/11250/3001129).
It is about implementing a model of version control systems in Cubical Agda, and the first chapter contains a pretty friendly introduction to HoTT.
You can read it [here](/files/cubical_hpt.pdf) and find the Agda code [here](https://github.com/Aqissiaq/hpt-experiments).

Also at UiB, I participated in the seminar course INF328B in the spring of 2021. The result is a short [essay](/files/INF328B_HOPL4_essays.pdf#page=40) summarizing the HOPL IV report on the history of JavaScript.

### Bachelor Thesis
My bachelor thesis is about using TLA+ to verify a concurrent hashmap algorithm.
You can read it [here](/files/bachelor.pdf) and poke around the specifications [here](https://github.com/Aqissiaq/bachelor).
